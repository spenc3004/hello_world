# hello_world
This is my first ever time using GitHub and i'm trying to get acquainted with it to build myself a little portfolio of code for whhen I graduate with a CS bachelors.
I have begun learing python during my first semester in college and plan to build on it and house my assignments here along with problems I solve on leetcode.com at the recommendation of my Intr to CS professor.
